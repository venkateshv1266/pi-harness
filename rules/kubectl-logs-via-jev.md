# Prefilter large kubectl logs with Jev

For an unbounded log dump, keep the existing Kubernetes pre-flight, save the raw output to a temporary file, then call the `triage_log` tool (ask-jev extension) with that file and a focused investigation question before reading the evidence. Jev only narrows and classifies the log; inspect its returned evidence and do the root-cause analysis yourself. A bounded `--tail` or file-redirection command should proceed without this interruption.
